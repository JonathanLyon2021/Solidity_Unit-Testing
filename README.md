# Solidity_Unit-Testing
This is a combination of exercises 4 & 5 from MI4 in Kingsland Universities Blockchain Developer Program.

# Exercise Goals
  The goal of this exercise is to build a contract for fund raising and create unit tests for it. Mechanics are the same as
the single Kickstarter campaign but there is a particular time to reach the goal. If this does not happen, donators are
free to request a refund of transferred Ether. If the goal is reached, the owner of the smart contact can withdraw
funds. We want to also allow for “anonymous” donation which is merely a transfer of funds to a smart contract.
Even if we are saying anonymous, you need to know that all transactions are publicly visible via Ether transfer. We
are just unable to refund those funds.
